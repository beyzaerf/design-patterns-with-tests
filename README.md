### Design Patterns with Unit Test

This repo contains my journey to learn unit tests and maven in depth, using Java and jUnit.

## Design Patterns
### Adapter
**Adapter** allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### Singleton

**Singleton** lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, 
while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Observer
**Also known as:** Event-Subscriber, Listener

Observer lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects 
about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can 
subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher.

- All implementations of `java.util.EventListener` use this pattern.
